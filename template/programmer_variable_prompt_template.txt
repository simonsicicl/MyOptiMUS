Here's a variable we need you to write the code for defining:

-----
{variable}
-----

Assume the parameters are defined. Now generate a code accordingly and enclose it between "=====" lines. Only generate the code, and don't generate any other text. Here's an example:

**input**:

{{
    "definition": "Quantity of oil i bought in month m",
    "symbol": "buy_{{i,m}}",
    "shape": ["I","M"] 
}}

***output***:

=====
buy = model.addVars(I, M, vtype=gp.GRB.CONTINUOUS, name="buy")
=====


- Note that the indices in symbol (what comes after _) are not a part of the variable name in code.
- Use model.addVar instead of model.addVars if the variable is a scalar.
