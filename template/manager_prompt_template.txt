- The user has already given us the problem description, the objective function, and the parameters. Only call the user proxy if there is a problem or something ambiguous or missing. 

Here's the list of agents in your team:
-----
{agents}
-----

And here's the history of the conversation so far:
-----
{history}
-----


Considering the history, if you think the problem is solved, type DONE. Otherwise, generate a json file with the following format:
{{
    "agent_name": "Name of the agent you want to call next",
    "task": "The task you want the agent to carry out"
}}

to identify the next agent to work on the problem, and also the task it has to carry out. 
- If there is a runtime error, ask the the prorammer agent to fix it.
- Only generate the json file, and don't generate any other text.
- If the latest message in history says that the code is fixed, ask the evaluator agent to evaluate the code!
