When running the following code snipper, an error happened:

-----
{prep_code}

{error_line}
-----

and here is the error message:

-----
{error_message}
-----

We know that the code for importing packages and defining parameters and variables is correct, and the error is because of the this last part which is for modeling the {target}:

-----
{error_line}
-----

First reason about the source of the error. Then, if the code is correct and the problem is likely to be in the formulation, generate a json in this format (the reason is why you think the problem is in the formulation):

{{
    "status": "correct",    
    "reason": "A string explaining why you think the problem is in the formulation"
}}

otherwise, fix the last part code and generate a json file with the following format:

{{
    "status": "fixed",
    "fixed_code": "A sting representing the fixed {target} modeling code to be replaced with the last part code"
}}

- Note that the fixed code should be the fixed version of the last part code, not the whole code snippet. Only fix the part that is for defining the {target}.
- Do not generate any text after the json file. 
- Variables should become before parameters when defining inequality constraints in gurobipy (because of the gurobi parsing order syntax)

Take a deep breath and solve the problem step by step.
